# Celtic_Whiskey_Dashboard

Celtic  Whiskey  Shop initially  had  no  proper  Business Intelligence  or  Business  Analytics model  and  the  data  was maintained  in  a  clumsy  way. So, I collected the  data from various sources of Celtic Whiskey shop and cleansed the data to developa new  Business Intelligence model for them through which they can analyse their present and past sales data.

# Transaction Dashboard

The  transaction  dashboard  displays  detailed  information about the transactions carried out by Celtic Whiskey Shop for different  products.

# Marketing Dashboard

The  purpose  of  the  marketing  dashboard  is  to  determine the marketing  strategy  of  the  company  and  how  the  current marketing strategy is performing against sales.  

# Operations Dashboard

The purpose of the Operations Dashboard is to illustrate all the necessary details related to the stock and cost of products to illustrate efficiencies and when needed a change strategy.

# CRM Dashboard

In this project Dynamics 365 has been utilized to implement a CRM system for Celtic Whiskey Shop. Being fairly active on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter or Instagram gives customers an easy and convenient way to connect with the organization. The emails or direct messages coming in are treated as data points based on which cases are created in the CRM system and a priority level is set for each of the cases.
